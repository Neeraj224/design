# Really Bad Design

Welcome to **Really Bad Design** – my chaotic playground for learning everything from high- to low-level network-based design and microservices.  

> **Disclaimer:** This repo is intentionally bad because it’s experimental. That’s the point.  

Expect:
- Random services calling each other
- Mockups for things that probably shouldn’t exist
- Unhinged behavior that sometimes breaks rules, just to see what happens

This is me **experimenting, having fun, and learning** – not production-ready code.
Anyhoo - so long, and thanks for all the fish!
